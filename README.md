# 📚 Design and Analysis of Algorithms Assignments Uploaded to GitHub!

Hello everyone! 👋

I've just uploaded all my code and assignments from my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course to my GitHub repository. If you're passionate about algorithms or looking for study resources, feel free to explore! 💡

The repository includes implementations and analyses of various algorithms such as:

- **Sorting Algorithms** (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort) 🔢
- **Search Algorithms** (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) 🔍
- **Dynamic Programming** (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence) 🧮
- **Greedy Algorithms** (Huffman Coding, Kruskal's Algorithm) ⚡
- **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm) 🌐
- **Divide and Conquer** strategies ✂️

You can check out the repository here: [Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms](https://github.com/VOYAGER441/DAA/) 🚀

Feel free to **fork**, **star**, or **clone** the repo. Any feedback, suggestions, or contributions are highly appreciated! Let's learn and grow together. 🤝

Happy coding! 🖥️
